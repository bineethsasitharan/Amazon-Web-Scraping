# Amazon-Web-Scraping

ðŸ“š This project involves performing basic web scraping on Amazon product pages to extract key details such as the brand, product description, price, and product link. The goal is to gather this information from various products listed on Amazon's website. This requires using appropriate scraping tools and techniques while ensuring compliance with Amazon's terms of use and legal considerations. The extracted data can then be organized and used for various purposes, such as analysis, research, or comparison.ðŸ“Š

### ðŸŽ¯ Web Scraping:
  ðŸ’« Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves using software or scripts to retrieve information from web pages, usually in an organized and structured format, such as a spreadsheet or database. Web scraping is commonly used to gather data for various purposes, including research, analysis, data entry, and more.

  Indeed, there are several popular libraries used in web scraping, and you've mentioned three important ones: requests, Beautiful Soup, Selenium and more. Let's take a closer look at each of them:

### ðŸ“Œ Requests: 
  âœ¨ The requests library in Python is used to make HTTP requests to web servers. It simplifies the process of sending GET and POST requests and receiving responses. While it doesn't directly parse HTML, it's often used in conjunction with other libraries, like Beautiful Soup, to retrieve web pages' content.

### ðŸ“Œ Beautiful Soup: 
  âœ¨ Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides tools for navigating and searching through the parsed HTML, making it easier to extract specific data from the web page. Beautiful Soup can work with different parsers and is particularly useful for extracting data from static web pages.

### ðŸ“Œ Selenium: 
  âœ¨ Unlike requests and Beautiful Soup, Selenium is a more versatile tool that simulates a web browser and can interact with dynamic websites, including those that heavily rely on JavaScript. Selenium allows you to automate browser actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and scrolling, making it suitable for cases where data is loaded dynamically after the initial page load.
